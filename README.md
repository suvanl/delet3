**Branches**

- Currently, the main development branch is [localisation](https://github.com/suvanl/delet3/tree/localisation)

- The [l10n_localisation2](https://github.com/suvanl/delet3/tree/l10n_localisation2) branch should not be directly worked on - it is reserved for changes made by the Crowdin integration when new translations are added. Pull requests will automatically be created by the integration to merge these changes into the **localisation** branch

- Changes from the **l10n_localisation2** branch are never directly merged into the [master](https://github.com/suvanl/delet3/tree/master) branch
